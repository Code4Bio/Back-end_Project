# Back-end_Project
This project focuses on backend and database development for my teacher's image analysis site.

This project is focused on enhancing the backend of an image analysis website. My contributions include implementing user authentication using the Flask framework, creating a PostgreSQL database to manage the site's data, and setting up a cloud server to host the dynamic website.
